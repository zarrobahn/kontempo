### Sass mixins

When using Bootstrap’s source Sass files, you have the option of using Sass variables and mixins to create custom, semantic, and responsive page layouts. Our predefined grid classes use these same variables and mixins to provide a whole suite of ready-to-use classes for fast responsive layouts.

## Variables

Variables and maps determine the number of columns, the gutter width, and the media query point at which to begin floating columns. We use these to generate the predefined grid classes documented above, as well as for the custom mixins listed below.

Content pages are of the type page and will therefore have all the page variables and site variables available to use in their templates.

posts/single.html
This single page template makes use of Hugo base templates, the .Format function for dates, the .WordCount page variable, and ranges through the single content’s specific taxonomies. with is also used to check whether the taxonomies are set in the front matter.
